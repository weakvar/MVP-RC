MVP module template with router and configurator for Xcode.<br>Create ready-made modules in a few clicks.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the MVP-RC repository.
2. Go to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates`. If you don't have the Templates folder, you must create it.
3. If the Templates folder is empty, create a `File Templates` folder and inside it another folder named `Custom`. You should get the following path: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Custom`.
4. Copy `MVP-RC Module.xctemplate` to `Custom` folder.
5. That's all, done.

### Usage

1. Open a project in Xcode.
3. Choose where you want to create a new MVP module, press `CMD+N` or go to `File -> New -> File`.
4. Search for the MVP-RC Module (it's at the bottom, in a section called Custom). 
5. Choose the template, enter a name for your next module and create it.
